# Genome Alignment Service

## Overview

The bacterial Genome Alignment Service uses [progressiveMauve](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0011147) to produce a whole genome alignment of two or more genomes.  The resulting alignment can be visualized within the BV-BRC website, providing insight into homologous regions and changes due to DNA recombination.  It should be noted that this service is currently released as *beta*.  As always, we appreciate your feedback.



## About this module

This module is a component of the BV-BRC build system. It is designed to fit into the
